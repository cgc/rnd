# Generating my house calendar

This HTML page is an attempt to faithfully recreate the visual layout of my house's monthly calendar that we usually make by hand.

## Making the PDF

Open the HTML page in Google Chrome. `File -> Print -> Destination: Save as PDF -> Save`. This seems to render slightly differently (extending to the end of the page) than when a printer is selected and `Open PDF in Preview` is clicked.

## Printing the PDF

From macOS Preview. `File -> Print`. Under "Paper Size", hover over "US Letter", but select "US Letter Borderless". Then print.
